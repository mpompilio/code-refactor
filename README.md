# code-refactor
The code-refactor project is project one of the GW Bootcamp Course

-- The goal was to refactor the code to make it look cleaner, and ultimatley run faster. 
-- To do this, I combined multiple css tags that were duplicates, in order to not have so much duplicate code. 
-- I have also changed the header, footer, and some of the div tags to more accurately tag the sections of the page. 
-- The Title of this page was also not appropriate, so I changed that to something that made a little more sense to the page. 
-- I also fixed the Navigation links, so that when a user presses an option on the list, it will take them to the correct location. 
-- The order of the CSS tags were also out of order, so I organized those a little better. 
-- I added comments to the page so that it would be easier for other developers to understand and navigate through.
